# Probability & Inference

## Overview

This course covers the fundamentals of probability theory and statistical inference. Topics in probability include random variables, distributions, expectations, moments, Jensen’s inequality, law of large numbers, central limit theorem. Topics in inference include maximum likelihood, point estimation (Bayesian, frequentist, and likelihood versions); hypothesis and significance testing; re-sampling techniques. Complex mathematical proofs will be illustrated with computational solutions.
