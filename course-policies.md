# Course Policies

## Grading

There are 14 course competencies.  For each competency, there is a deliverable (usually a simulation study) and a section within the comprehensive final exam.  Each deliverable and final exam section will be graded on a pass/fail basis.  Students will have opportunities to retake or resubmit course work and final exam sections for re-evaluation.  The successful completion of a course competency occurs when the student passes the corresponding deliverable and final exam section.

| Competency  | Deliverable | Final Exam|
|---|---|---|
| Simulation & Operating characteristics  |   |   |
| Sampling  |   |   |
| Transformations & statistics |   |   |
| Common data generation distributions |   |   |
| Sampling distributions  |   |   |
| Bootstrap distributions  |   |   |
| Asymptotics  |   |   |
| Bivariate Samples I  |   |   |
| Bivariate Samples II  |   |   |
| Inference Overview  |   |   |
| Likelihood Inference |   |   |
| Bayes Inference |   |   |
| Rank/Permutation Inference |   |   |
| Sensitivity, Specificity, Power |   |   |

In addition to coursework, there will be a final project.

Final grades will be assigned as follows.

| Grade | Requirement |
|---|---|
| C | Successful completion of 10 course competencies |
| B | Successful completion of 14 course competencies |
| A | Successful completion of 14 course competencies and successful completion of a final project |
| F | Otherwise |

## Adjustments

The instructor may alter the course content and grading policies during the semester.

## Collaborative learning

Students are encouraged to study together.  The instructions for each deliverable will indicate if and how students may work together on the deliverable.  Students should not collaborate on the final exam.  Students that violate the collaborative-work policy on an deliverable will fail the deliverable in question and forfeit the opportunity to retake or resubmit.  Students that violate the collaborative-work policy on the final exam will fail all sections of the final exam and forfeit the opportunity to retake or resubmit.
